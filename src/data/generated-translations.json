Установите и откройте приложение.  \n2. Создайте аккаунт или войдите (e‑mail).  \n3. Добавьте первый автомобиль (марка, модель, год, VIN опционально).  \n4. Задайте единицы измерения (км/ми) и язык в настройках.\n## 2. Автомобили\n- Добавление/редактирование/удаление авто.  \n- Поля: марка, модель, год, VIN, номер (опционально).  \n- Обновление пробега; вложения (документы/заметки).  \n- Поддержка нескольких авто.\n## 3. Поездки\n### 3.1 Ручной учет (Бесплатно)\n- Создание поездки: старт/финиш, дистанция, заметки.  \n- Категории и теги.\n### 3.2 Навигация и автоматическое отслеживание (Премиум)\n1. Найдите цель (адрес/место/координаты).  \n2. Добавьте промежуточные точки (по желанию).  \n3. Запустите навигацию и следуйте инструкциям.  \n4. Автоматическое отслеживание работает во время активной навигации: записывает дистанцию и маршрут в фоне.  \n5. Автоперестроение маршрута при отклонении.\nПримечания:  \n- Карты: Mapbox.  \n- Навигация и маршруты: Valhalla (собственный сервер), Mapbox как резервный.  \n- Поиск: Nominatim.  \n- Влияние на батарею: GPS потребляет больше энергии.  \n- Всегда соблюдайте ПДД.\n## 4. Обслуживание\n### 4.1 ИИ‑планы ТО\n- На основе данных авто и пробега.  \n- Предложения по интервалам и расходникам.\n### 4.2 Напоминания\n- Напоминания приходят автоматически на основе ИИ‑планов обслуживания и установленных интервалов.  \n- Включите push‑уведомления в настройках (нужны разрешения устройства).\n## 5. Синхронизация\n- Аккаунт через Supabase; данные синхронизируются между устройствами.  \n- Offline‑first: изменения отправляются при восстановлении сети.  \n- Конфликты: побеждает последняя правка; при необходимости исправьте вручную.\n## 6. Настройки\n- Единицы (км/ми), язык, формат времени (12/24 часа), формат температуры (°C/°F).  \n- Уведомления (ТО, трекинг).  \n- Конфиденциальность: удаление аккаунта, отказ от аналитики.  \n- Опции карты: трафик, 3D, масштаб, избегать платных дорог, избегать автомагистралей, избегать водных переправ.\n## 7. Советы по точности\n- Держите GPS включенным; при необходимости настройте энергосбережение.  \n- Для определения направления движения всегда используется технология «movement‑bearing».  \n- Обновляйте приложение.\n## 8. Решение проблем\n- Нет GPS‑позиции: проверьте разрешения и службы геолокации.  \n- Навигация остановилась: проверьте интернет/GPS, перезапустите приложение.  \n- Синхронизация зависла: проверьте подключение и повторите позже.  \n- Свяжитесь с поддержкой (ниже).\n## 9. Конфиденциальность\n- Локация используется только при активной навигации/треккинге.  \n- Анонимная аналитика для улучшения качества.  \n- Подробности: `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY_RU.md`, `legal/GDPR_COMPLIANCE_RU.md`.\n## 10.

    "userManual": "## Вступ\nOdomate — додаток для керування автомобілем, навігації та обліку поїздок з ШІ‑рекомендаціями з обслуговування.\n## 1. Початок роботи\n1. Встановіть та відкрийте додаток.  \n2. Створіть акаунт або увійдіть (e‑mail).  \n3. Додайте перший автомобіль (марка, модель, рік, VIN опціонально).  \n4. Задайте одиниці вимірювання (км/ми) та мову в налаштуваннях.\n## 2. Автомобілі\n- Додавання/редагування/видалення авто.  \n- Поля: марка, модель, рік, VIN, номер (опціонально).  \n- Оновлення пробігу; вкладення (документи/замітки).  \n- Підтримка кількох авто.\n## 3. Поїздки\n### 3.1 Ручний облік (Безкоштовно)\n- Створення поїздки: старт/фініш, дистанція, замітки.  \n- Категорії та теги.\n### 3.2 Навігація та автоматичне відстеження (Преміум)\n1. Знайдіть ціль (адреса/місце/координати).  \n2. Додайте проміжні точки (за бажанням).  \n3. Запустіть навігацію та слідуйте інструкціям.  \n4. Автоматичне відстеження працює під час активної навігації: записує дистанцію та маршрут у фоні.  \n5. Автоперебудова маршруту при відхиленні.\nПримітки:  \n- Карти: Mapbox.  \n- Навігація та маршрути: Valhalla (власний сервер), Mapbox як резервний.  \n- Пошук: Nominatim.  \n- Вплив на батарею: GPS споживає більше енергії.  \n- Завжди дотримуйтесь ПДР.\n## 4. Обслуговування\n### 4.1 ШІ‑плани ТО\n- На основі даних авто та пробігу.  \n- Пропозиції щодо інтервалів та витратних матеріалів.\n### 4.2 Нагадування\n- Нагадування приходять автоматично на основі ШІ‑планів обслуговування та встановлених інтервалів.  \n- Увімкніть push‑сповіщення в налаштуваннях (потрібні дозволи пристрою).\n## 5. Синхронізація\n- Акаунт через Supabase; дані синхронізуються між пристроями.  \n- Offline‑first: зміни відправляються при відновленні мережі.  \n- Конфлікти: перемагає остання правка; при необхідності виправте вручну.\n## 6. Налаштування\n- Одиниці (км/ми), мова, формат часу (12/24 години), формат температури (°C/°F).  \n- Сповіщення (ТО, трекінг).  \n- Конфіденційність: видалення акаунту, відмова від аналітики.  \n- Опції карти: трафік, 3D, масштаб, уникати платних доріг, уникати автомагістралей, уникати водних переправ.\n## 7. Поради щодо точності\n- Тримайте GPS увімкненим; при необхідності налаштуйте енергозбереження.  \n- Для визначення напрямку руху завжди використовується технологія «movement‑bearing».  \n- Оновлюйте додаток.\n## 8. Вирішення проблем\n- Немає GPS‑позиції: перевірте дозволи та служби геолокації.  \n- Навігація зупинилася: перевірте інтернет/GPS, перезапустіть додаток.  \n- Синхронізація зависла: перевірте підключення та повторіть пізніше.  \n- Зв'яжіться з підтримкою (нижче).\n## 9. Конфіденційність\n- Локація використовується тільки при активній навігації/трекінгу.  \n- Анонімна аналітика для покращення якості.  \n- Подробиці: `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY_UK.md`, `legal/GDPR_COMPLIANCE_UK.md`.\n## 10.

Zainstaluj i uruchom aplikację.  \n2. Utwórz konto lub zaloguj się (e‑mail).  \n3. Dodaj pierwszy pojazd (marka, model, rok, VIN opcjonalnie).  \n4. Ustaw jednostki (km/mi) i język w Ustawieniach.\n## 2. Pojazdy\n- Dodawanie/edycja/usuwanie pojazdów.  \n- Pola: marka, model, rok, VIN, numer rejestracyjny (opcjonalnie).  \n- Aktualizacja przebiegu; załączniki (dokumenty/notatki).  \n- Obsługa wielu pojazdów.\n## 3. Przejazdy\n### 3.1 Ręczne dodawanie (Darmowe)\n- Nowy przejazd: start/koniec, dystans, notatki.  \n- Kategorie i tagi.\n### 3.2 Nawigacja i automatyczne śledzenie (Premium)\n1. Wyszukaj cel (adres/miejsce/współrzędne).  \n2. Dodaj punkty pośrednie (opcjonalnie).  \n3. Rozpocznij nawigację i podążaj za wskazówkami.  \n4. Automatyczne śledzenie działa podczas aktywnej nawigacji: zapisuje dystans i trasę w tle.  \n5. Automatyczne przeobliczanie trasy przy zejściu z kursu.\nUwagi:  \n- Mapy: Mapbox.  \n- Nawigacja i trasy: Valhalla (samodzielnie hostowane), Mapbox jako zapasowy.  \n- Wyszukiwanie: Nominatim.  \n- Uwaga na baterię: GPS zwiększa zużycie energii.  \n- Zawsze przestrzegaj przepisów ruchu drogowego.\n## 4. Serwis\n### 4.1 Plany serwisowe AI\n- Na podstawie danych pojazdu i przebiegu.  \n- Propozycje interwałów i części serwisowych.\n### 4.2 Przypomnienia\n- Przypomnienia są wysyłane automatycznie na podstawie planów serwisowych AI i ustawionych interwałów.  \n- Włącz powiadomienia push w ustawieniach (wymagana zgoda urządzenia).\n## 5. Synchronizacja\n- Konto przez Supabase; dane synchronizują się między urządzeniami.  \n- Offline‑first: zmiany są wysyłane po odzyskaniu połączenia.  \n- Konflikty: ostatnia zmiana wygrywa; w razie potrzeby skoryguj ręcznie.\n## 6. Ustawienia\n- Jednostki (km/mi), język, format czasu (12/24 godziny), format temperatury (°C/°F).  \n- Powiadomienia (serwis, śledzenie).  \n- Prywatność: usunięcie konta, wyłączenie analityki.  \n- Opcje mapy: ruch drogowy, 3D, skala, unikaj płatnych dróg, unikaj autostrad, unikaj promów.\n## 7. Wskazówki dot. dokładności\n- Pozostaw włączony GPS; ewentualnie dostosuj oszczędzanie energii.  \n- Technologia movement‑bearing jest zawsze używana do określania kierunku ruchu.  \n- Aktualizuj aplikację.\n## 8. Rozwiązywanie problemów\n- Brak pozycji GPS: sprawdź uprawnienia i usługi lokalizacji.  \n- Nawigacja zatrzymuje się: sprawdź Internet/GPS, uruchom ponownie aplikację.  \n- Synchronizacja utknęła: sprawdź połączenie i spróbuj ponownie.  \n- Skontaktuj się z pomocą (poniżej).\n## 9. Prywatność\n- Lokalizacja tylko przy aktywnej nawigacji/śledzeniu.  \n- Anonimowa analityka w celu poprawy jakości.  \n- Szczegóły: `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY_PL.md`, `legal/GDPR_COMPLIANCE_PL.md`.\n## 10.

Instala y abre la app.  \n2. Crea una cuenta o inicia sesión (correo).  \n3. Añade tu primer vehículo (marca, modelo, año, VIN opcional).  \n4. Define unidades (km/mi) e idioma en Ajustes.\n## 2. Vehículos\n- Añadir/editar/eliminar vehículos.  \n- Campos: marca, modelo, año, VIN, matrícula (opcional).  \n- Actualiza el odómetro; adjunta documentos/notas.  \n- Soporte multi‑vehículo.\n## 3. Viajes\n### 3.1 Registro manual (Gratis)\n- Crea un viaje: inicio/fin, distancia, notas.  \n- Asigna categorías y etiquetas.\n### 3.2 Navegación y seguimiento automático (Premium)\n1. Busca destino (dirección/lugar/coordenadas).  \n2. Añade paradas (opcional).  \n3. Inicia la navegación y sigue las indicaciones.  \n4. El seguimiento automático funciona durante la navegación activa: registra distancia y ruta en segundo plano.  \n5. Recalcula automáticamente si te desvías.\nNotas:  \n- Mapas: Mapbox.  \n- Navegación y rutas: Valhalla (auto-alojado), Mapbox como respaldo.  \n- Búsqueda: Nominatim.  \n- Batería: el GPS consume más energía.  \n- Respeta siempre las normas de tráfico.\n## 4. Mantenimiento\n### 4.1 Planes IA\n- Basados en datos del vehículo y kilometraje.  \n- Sugerencias de intervalos y componentes.\n### 4.2 Recordatorios\n- Los recordatorios se envían automáticamente basándose en los planes de mantenimiento IA y los intervalos establecidos.  \n- Activa notificaciones push en ajustes (requiere permiso del dispositivo).\n## 5. Sincronización\n- Cuenta mediante Supabase; sincroniza entre dispositivos.  \n- Offline‑first: cambios se envían al reconectar.  \n- Conflictos: prevalece el último cambio; corrige manualmente si es necesario.\n## 6. Ajustes\n- Unidades (km/mi), idioma, formato de hora (12/24 horas), formato de temperatura (°C/°F).  \n- Notificaciones (mantenimiento, seguimiento).  \n- Privacidad: borrar cuenta, desactivar analíticas.  \n- Opciones de mapa: tráfico, 3D, escala, evitar peajes, evitar autopistas, evitar ferries.\n## 7. Consejos de precisión\n- Mantén el GPS activo; ajusta ahorro de energía si hace falta.  \n- La tecnología movement‑bearing siempre se utiliza para determinar la dirección del movimiento.  \n- Mantén la app actualizada.\n## 8. Solución de problemas\n- Sin posición GPS: revisa permisos y servicios de ubicación.  \n- Navegación se detiene: revisa Internet/GPS, reinicia la app.  \n- Sincronización atascada: revisa conexión y reintenta.  \n- Contacta soporte (abajo).\n## 9. Privacidad\n- Ubicación solo con navegación/seguimiento activos.  \n- Analíticas anónimas para mejorar calidad.  \n- Detalles: `legal/PRIVACY_POLICY_ES.md`, `legal/GDPR_COMPLIANCE_ES.md`.\n## 10.
